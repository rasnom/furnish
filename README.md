# furnish
WordPress plugin for collaborative selection of fixtures, finishes, and other details before beginning a construction project.

## rough work plan
1. Create a 'hello world' style basic plugin
1. Add a form that can add entries to the site's database
1. Integrate with some kind of login that gates the form
1. Allow the form to retrieve the saved copy for a given login and edit it
1. Populate the form with all of the necessary fields for bathroom finish selection
1. At least one round of testing and refinement of the bathroom finish selection tool
1. Create a kitchen finish form
1. Make the form customizable to site admin
1. Make the kitchena and bathroom details into templates that can be applied to a new form
